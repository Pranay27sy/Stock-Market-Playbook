# Understanding Relative Strength Index (RSI)

## Basic Explanation

1. RSI is an indicator.
2. It is a momentum oscillator indicator.
3. It measures the speed and strength of price movement over a specific period of time.
4. As it is an oscillator indicator, it oscillates between 0 and 100.
5. When the RSI is below 30, the stock is said to be oversold, and if the RSI is above 70, the stock is said to be overbought.

## Formula for Calculating RSI

**Step 1** – Select a period. Usually, 14 data points (if the timeframe is daily, then 14 days, likewise).  
**Step 2** – Calculate average gain and average loss (the closing price is mostly considered for calculation).  
**Step 3** – Calculate relative strength (RS): Average Gain / Average Loss.  
**Step 4** – Calculate the RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)].

## Cases

1. If, for the selected period, the average loss is zero, then the RSI becomes 100.
2. If, for the selected period, the average gain is zero, then the RSI becomes 0.
3. If, for the selected period, there is no gain and no loss, then the RSI becomes 50.

## What is RSI Divergence?

RSI divergence basically means that the stock price and RSI value are moving in opposite directions, indicating a potential reversal.

### Types

1. Bullish divergence
2. Bearish divergence

### Explanation

1. **Bullish Divergence**  
   The stock price keeps making lower lows, and the RSI makes higher lows.  

   **Intuition**: When a stock starts falling, initially the fall is severe (strong bearish momentum), so the RSI also falls. As the trend progresses, the momentum weakens (as RSI is calculated for a 14-period rolling window), so the RSI starts making higher lows (starts rising), while the stock keeps making lower lows.

2. **Bearish Divergence**  
   The stock price keeps making higher highs, and the RSI makes lower highs.

   **Intuition**: During the initial uptrend, the gains are large (strong bullish momentum), so the RSI rises quickly. As the trend progresses, the gains become smaller, and the average gain for the 14-period rolling window starts decreasing, causing the RSI to fall.

## Personal Opinion

If a stock has strong reasons to fall, it can keep falling even if the RSI is below 30.

If a stock’s RSI has formed a bullish divergence, it is not necessarily an indication that a reversal is imminent. It may happen that the downward trend is still intact, and the stock is consolidating, which causes the RSI to rise (as RSI is calculated for a 14-period rolling window). Once the consolidation is over, the stock may continue its trend.

If a stock rises 20% in a single day, the rise in RSI for that particular day will depend on the average gain of the past 14 days (including the gain of that day) and the average loss of the past 14 days.  
- If the average loss and average gain are small, the RSI will jump considerably.  
- If the average loss or average gain is large, the RSI will increase but less drastically.
